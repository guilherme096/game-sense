## Apontamentos

1. Discuss individual work
   - Everyone discussed their assigned work
2. Sprint review and retrospective
   - Work planning and task assignment - Due to the uncertainty about the work being done, some tasks were not
     well distributed and some were not even thought of. This led to last minute work assignments and the project management system
     didn't keep up with the changes - In the next sprint we will have to investigate more about the tasks so that we can better prepare
     the sprint planning and task assignment.
